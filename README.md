# ðŸ§  Solidity Mini Projects

Welcome to my Solidity mini-projects repository â€” a space where I explore core concepts of smart contract development by building real use-case inspired contracts.

This repo contains a growing collection of mini-projects, each focusing on applying **a specific Solidity/Web3 concept**, such as mappings, modifiers, voting logic.

## ðŸ“Œ Whatâ€™s Inside

Each contract is created with clarity and learning in mind. Some examples of concepts applied so far:

- âœ… Data Structures â€“ `struct`, `mapping`, `array`, `nested mappings`
- âœ… Access Control â€“ `onlyOwner`, custom modifiers
- âœ… Payment Logic â€“ `payable`, fund management, ETH transfer
- âœ… State Management â€“ `require`, error handling, resetting state
- âœ… DAO Fundamentals â€“ proposal creation, voting, funding
- âœ… Web2-to-Web3 â€“ converting familiar ideas like quote generators to smart contracts
- âœ… OOP Mapping â€“ translating object-oriented logic into contract-based thinking
